This programme measures the execution time of some fibonacci functions.

The main aim is to execute the time it takes each function to generate the ith + 1 value after generating the ith value.

On 18/July/21, I added some new files that did the same thing but implementing OOP.

The OOP files are in the main branch while the functional programming files are in the master branch

This programme aims to explain the use case of OOP as compared to functional programming.

The OOP performed far better in measuring and plotting the execution time,
but it could not work with one of the fibonacci functions that contain a dictionary argument.

The decorator function can decorate any function to return an iterator and measure the execution time of generating each values in the iterator.

In practice it should work for any function that do not cache values with a dictionary argument and generate a natural or a list of natural numbers.

It is a project in progress and I will soon add the functionality where it will work for all use cases and functions.

The public is enjoined to contribute any suggestions.
