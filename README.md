This program measures the execution time of some fibonacci functions.

The main aim is to execute the time it takes each function to generate the ith + 1 value after generating the ith value.

On 18/July/21, I added some new files that did the same thing but implementing OOP.

This programme aims to explain the use case of OOP as compared to functional programming.

The OOP performed far better in measuring and plotting the execution time,
but it could not work with one of the fibonacci functions that contain a dictionary argument.

The public is enjoined to contribute any suggestions.
